# Notes_BlockchainSolidityPy
Notes and code taken while following "Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course": https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-py. That course from [@PatrickAlphaC](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC) rocks!

The following code is based on the one that Patrick shows in his classes. Normally this code is slightly extended/modified or simply more comments are added.
